# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on tribute page as HTML and CSS exercise. 

**Thoughts:** I learnt the difference between the CSS box-sizing properties, namely 'box-sizing:content-box;' and 'box-sizing:border-box;' This is useful when padding padding text within a div element  

**Link to work:** [Tribute page](https://github.com/SamHSoftware/HTML-and-HTML5/tree/master/Tribute%20page:%20William%20Earnest%20Henley)
