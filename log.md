# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: My first time using HTML and CSS. Worked on tribute page as HTML and CSS exercise. 

**Thoughts:** I learnt the difference between the CSS box-sizing properties, namely ```box-sizing:content-box;``` and ```box-sizing:border-box;``` This is useful when padding padding text within a ```div``` element.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added a timeline to tribute page. 

**Thoughts:** (1) Producing multiple timline boxes has been an exercise in efficient coding. It is more efficient (and clearer) to create reusuable classes, than to create non-reusuable classes, which can multiply quicky when creating multiple repeating elements (such as those which appear throughout the physical progression of a timeline). 
(2) It's interesting dealing with a language which doesn't have an explicit ```if``` statement. (3) The ```:nth-child``` selector is awesome.

### Day 2: June 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on timeline. 

**Thoughts:** (1) Learnt the differnce between ```span``` and ```div``` elements. (2) It's intersting how position is altered by ```position: absolute;```. Also, to position an element with  ```position: absolute;``` within a container, that container needs to have  ```position``` set to  ```relative```.

### Day 3: June 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Read up on optimising repeating element layout. 

**Thoughts:** (1) While ```:nth-child``` is great, I've learnt that it needs to be applied to non-child classes which are all of the same level. I didn't originally organise my code in this manner, and thus I may need to backtrack and redo some stuff. Good lesson to learn for future projects.
