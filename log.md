# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on tribute page as HTML and CSS exercise. 

**Thoughts:** I learnt the difference between the CSS box-sizing properties, namely ```box-sizing:content-box;``` and ```box-sizing:border-box;``` This is useful when padding padding text within a ```div``` element.

### Day 1: June 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added a timeline to tribute page. 

**Thoughts:** (1) Producing multiple timline boxes has been an exercise in efficient coding. It is more efficient (and clearer) to create reusuable classes, than to create non-reusuable classes, which can multiply quicky when creating multiple repeating elements (such as those which appear throughout the physical progression of a timeline). 
(2) It's interesting dealing with a language which doesn't have an explicit ```if``` statement. (3) The ```article:nth-child``` selector is awesome.
