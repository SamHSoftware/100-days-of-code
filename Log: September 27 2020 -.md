# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learning debuggin techniques in JS. 

**Thoughts:** Useful practice, and mostly basic with many simlarities to debugging in other languages. I came across the concept of 'pass by refernce' and 'pass by value' in the form of a bug. Really interesting. I now know that JS is a 'pass by value' language which employs 'calls by sharing'.
